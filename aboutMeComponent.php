                    <p>Outside of web development I have varied hobbies and interests which include home <span>DIY projects</span>, <span>hiking</span>, 
                        <span>swimming</span>, <span>creative writing</span> and <span>gaming</span>.</p>
                    <p>I'm also the worlds geekiest <span>science fiction fan</span>, with a neat little collection of models, comics and paraphernalia.<p>
                    <p>I like having interests that tear me away from my day job. Interests that allow me to be creative in other ways, thereby not stagnating.</p>
                    <p>As a result it keeps my <span>creativity</span> fresh and often provides a different perspective when doing web development.</p>
